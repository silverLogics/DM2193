Proof of Concept 1
Daniel Zeng

Library:
https://github.com/ianprime0509/pitchy

Use "02 20000 hertz"
p5 editor: https://editor.p5js.org/
map different frequency ranges to different colors
Note Frequencies: https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html
Have popup on site start with instructions
Make the window larger

Queue Library
https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/datastructures-js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/datastructures-js@12.0.0/index.min.js

7 Queue small size successful in reducing canvas lag

8 Made window size relative to max and min of song, instead of 88 piano key range, 
since not good with complex songs
Verified accuracy with 440 Hz -> good

9 Colored 2 different bands of frequencies different colors
Red for high, blue for low
Listeners for audio end and mouse move
Preliminary scoring

Can set favi icon for more personalization for site

            Click Start to Start. If the audio plays, but nothing shows on the canvas, reload the page.

            Or wait for the javascript to completely
            <br>
            The black bar will follow your cursor's vertical position on the canvas. 
            <br>
            The objective is to keep your cursor aligned to the music notes, which will come from the right. 
            <br>
            Higher scores are BAD! They mean you made a lot of mistakes!
            <br>
            Good Luck!
