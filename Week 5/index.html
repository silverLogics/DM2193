<!--
    Use display: flex or display: grid, for responsive web
    When you set a container to flex, its children also become flex. 
    Flex behavior is diffferent from standard inline. 

    Instead of margins and padding, you can do justify-content: space-around
    align-items shifts positioning along the y-axis
