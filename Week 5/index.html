    Use display: flex or display: grid, for responsive web
    When you set a container to flex, its children also become flex. 
    Flex behavior is diffferent from standard inline. 

    Instead of margins and padding, you can do justify-content: space-around
    align-items shifts positioning along the y-axis

    Your site must include:
    Design plan including wire frame
    at least three HTML pages
    external css styling
    padding(), margin(), border()
    the viewport meta tag
    flex display

    <h1>Personal Effects</h1>
    <h2>from Solmaz Sharif</h2>

    <p>This album is a <b>stop-loss</b>. By a dim lantern</p>
    <p>by <b>standing order</b>,</p>
    <p>a <b>spreading fire</b> in his chest,</p>
    <p>his groin. He is on <b>stage</b></p>

    <p>But <em>I am sure they are alright</em> you wrote <em>Well</em> to reassure yourself</p>
    <p><em>Hello</em></p>

    <p><em>Congratulations and condolences</em></p>
    <p><em>That's the house of a martyr</em></p>
    <p><em>That's the mother of a martyr</em></p>
    <p>with his <b>personal effects.</b></p>
    <p><em>He didn’t want to have </em></p>
    <p><em>anything</em></p>
    <p><em>to do with it. </em></p>

    <p>to <b>neutralize</b></p>
    <p>the <b>capability</b> of <b>low dollar value items</b></p>
    <p>a "<b>casualty</b>." Unclear whether</p>
    <p>from a <b>catalytic</b> or <b>frontal attack</b>, unclear</p>
    <p><b>catastrophic event</b>.</p>
    <p>Just, <b>destroyed</b>.</p>
    <p><b>died of wounds received in action</b>.</p>
    <p><b>early warning</b>.</p>
    <p>In <b>execution planning</b>, they weighed</p>
    <p>the losses, the <b>sustainability</b></p>
    <p>approaching <em>Hello</em>.</p>

    <p><em>begin</em>. I say <em>end</em></p>
    <p>I say <em>chew 40 times</em></p>
    <p><em>before swallowing, slime,</em></p>
    <p><em>is this the freedom</em></p>
    <p><em>they want for us?</em> It was from his friend's</p>
    <p><em>my son, my son</em>.</p>

    <p>A grief we don't attempt to <b>console</b>.</p>
    <p><em>I killed him</em> she'll tell me</p>
    <p><b>celestial guidance</b></p>
    <p>in the midst of <b>civil affairs</b></p>
    <p>grief is a <b>closed area</b></p>
    <p><b>clutter</b>ed with his fork against the plate</p>
    <p>my dear <b>collateral damage</b>,</p>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><em>take that poster down</em> my father said</p>
    <p><em>get down get down</em></p>
    <p>As Tolstoy wrote in a letter: 
        <em>And yet, from nearby, all this wasn’t at all as frightening as might be supposed . . . 
        it was a question of who would burn the most powder, 
        and at the very most 30 men were killed on both sides by these thousands of cannon shots . . .</em></p>

    <p><em>freefall</em></p>
    <p>to disarm. <em>Stay</em>.</p>
    <p><em>(December)</em>. They say move,</p>
    <p><em>Well. Ok. Sorry. I had</em></p>

    <p><em>Well maybe I am next.</em></p>

    <p><em>Ok. Bye for real</em></p>
    <p><em>this time</em> you signed off</p>

    <p><b>heavy drop</b> sob</p>
    <p><b>person eligible to receive effects</b></p>
    <p>A <b>pillbox</b> of opium</p>

    <p><em>I burn my finger on the broiler</em></p>
    <p><em>and smell trenches, my uncle</em></p>
    <p><em>pissing himself</em>. "How can she write that?</p>

    <p>And when I sounded out M-EE-N to mean <em>mine</em> a hole appeared in the letter</p>
    <p>And I place in his eyes a <b>look</b> we share in the rearview</p>

    <p><em>Hello</em> you'd approach</p>
    <p><em>Hello. Do you know who I am?</em></p>
    <p><em>Amoo Javad</em> I'd say.</p>
    <p><em>Janam</em> you would respond—</p>
    <p><em>My life, my soul</em>, you'd say—</p>
    <p><em>Na kheyr</em>, for example—</p>
    <p>Or <em>Baleh</em>. As in you say</p>
    <p><em>Do you know who I am</em></p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>.</p>

    <p><em>I burn my finger on the broiler</em></p>
    <p><em>and smell trenches, my uncle</em></p>
    <p><em>pissing himself</em>. "How can she write that?</p>
    <p><em>Hello. Do you know who I am?</em></p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>, I tell you, I half-lie,</p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>. An address, beloved</p>
    <p><em>Yes, Amoo.</em></p>
