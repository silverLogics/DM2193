    <h1>Personal Effects</h1>
    <h2>from Solmaz Sharif</h2>

    <p>But <em>I am sure they are alright</em> you wrote <em>Well</em> to reassure yourself</p>
    <p><em>Hello</em></p>

    <p><em>Congratulations and condolences</em></p>
    <p><em>That's the house of a martyr</em></p>
    <p><em>That's the mother of a martyr</em></p>
    <p>with his <b>personal effects.</b></p>
    <p><em>He didn’t want to have </em></p>
    <p><em>anything</em></p>
    <p><em>to do with it. </em></p>

    <p>approaching <em>Hello</em>.</p>

    <p><em>begin</em>. I say <em>end</em></p>
    <p>I say <em>chew 40 times</em></p>
    <p><em>before swallowing, slime,</em></p>
    <p><em>is this the freedom</em></p>
    <p><em>they want for us?</em> It was from his friend's</p>
    <p><em>my son, my son</em>.</p>

    <p><em>I killed him</em> she'll tell me</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>the chase scene in <em>Bullitt</em></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><em>take that poster down</em> my father said</p>
    <p><em>get down get down</em></p>
    <p>As Tolstoy wrote in a letter: 
        <em>And yet, from nearby, all this wasn’t at all as frightening as might be supposed . . . 
        it was a question of who would burn the most powder, 
        and at the very most 30 men were killed on both sides by these thousands of cannon shots . . .</em></p>

    <p><em>freefall</em></p>
    <p>to disarm. <em>Stay</em>.</p>
    <p><em>(December)</em>. They say move,</p>
    <p><em>Well. Ok. Sorry. I had</em></p>

    <p><em>Well maybe I am next.</em></p>

    <p><em>Ok. Bye for real</em></p>
    <p><em>this time</em> you signed off</p>

    <p><em>I burn my finger on the broiler</em></p>
    <p><em>and smell trenches, my uncle</em></p>
    <p><em>pissing himself</em>. "How can she write that?</p>

    <p>And when I sounded out M-EE-N to mean <em>mine</em> a hole appeared in the letter</p>

    <p><em>Hello</em> you'd approach</p>
    <p><em>Hello. Do you know who I am?</em></p>
    <p><em>Amoo Javad</em> I'd say.</p>
    <p><em>Janam</em> you would respond—</p>
    <p><em>My life, my soul</em>, you'd say—</p>
    <p><em>Na kheyr</em>, for example—</p>
    <p>Or <em>Baleh</em>. As in you say</p>
    <p><em>Do you know who I am</em></p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>.</p>

    <p><em>I burn my finger on the broiler</em></p>
    <p><em>and smell trenches, my uncle</em></p>
    <p><em>pissing himself</em>. "How can she write that?</p>
    <p><em>Hello. Do you know who I am?</em></p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>, I tell you, I half-lie,</p>
    <p><em>Yes</em>. An address, beloved</p>
    <p><em>Yes, Amoo.</em></p>
